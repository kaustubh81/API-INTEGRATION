Project Description: SkyVibe – Live Weather Pulse

SkyVibe is an innovative, real-time weather application that seamlessly integrates modern web technologies to provide users with an immersive and responsive experience. Designed with a futuristic aesthetic and intuitive UI, the application fetches and displays live weather data for any city in the world using the Open-Meteo API. SkyVibe goes beyond basic weather reporting by combining live particle animations, adaptive themes, and smooth user interactions, delivering both functionality and visual appeal.

At its core, the application allows users to enter a city name and receive up-to-date weather information including temperature and a dynamic weather description. When a city is entered, the app first uses the Open-Meteo geocoding API to convert the city name into geographic coordinates. These coordinates are then used to retrieve current weather data, such as temperature and weather conditions, through an additional API call. The retrieved data is displayed with animated text transitions for a modern look.

SkyVibe includes an automatic geolocation feature that fetches the user’s current location (with permission) and displays weather data without any manual input. If location access is denied, the app defaults to showing Mumbai's weather. This feature ensures that the application remains functional and user-friendly under different conditions.

A standout feature of the app is its intelligent theme engine. The background theme changes automatically based on the user’s local time—light for day and dark for night. However, a manual toggle switch allows users to override this setting and switch between day and night themes as desired. The background transitions are powered by animated gradients, creating a visually engaging experience that reflects the time of day and mood.

To enhance the interactive experience, tsParticles.js is used to display weather-based particle animations in the background. For instance, if the weather description includes terms like "snow", "rain", or "cloud", the particle system dynamically changes its shape and movement style to represent snowflakes, raindrops, or drifting clouds. These particles float subtly in the background and respond to user interaction (like mouse hover), creating a responsive visual environment.

SkyVibe also employs Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, allowing for a clean, responsive design with minimal custom CSS. It uses Google Fonts (Orbitron) and Animate.css to apply stylish fonts and entry animations to key UI elements like headers and weather data fields. These animations make the interface lively and engaging without being distracting.

All of these features are encapsulated in a single-page application (SPA) that loads quickly and is fully responsive across devices. From its smooth transitions and live data fetching to background particle effects and auto-theming, SkyVibe is not just a weather app—it’s an experience. Whether used on a desktop or mobile device, SkyVibe offers users an aesthetically pleasing and informative look at the weather, blending design and functionality in a modern, accessible web application.
